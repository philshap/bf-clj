When a `bf` program starts, it creates an array of bytes in memory (by convention 30,000 bytes long, each byte initial足ized to 0) and a pointer into that array (initial足ized to the 0 posi足tion). The current byte is the byte in the array at the location indicated by the pointer.

Then it runs the code of the bf program, which consists of six operations:

- `>`  Increase the pointer position by one
- `<`  Decrease the pointer position by one
- `+`  Increase the value of the current byte by one
- `-`  Decrease the value of the current byte by one
- `.`  Write the current byte to stdout
- `,`  Read a byte from stdin and store it in the current byte (overwriting the existing value)

`bf` also has a looping construct `[` `]` that will repeat the code within the brackets until the current byte is zero. If the current byte is already zero, the loop will not run. Loops can be recur足sively nested within other loops.

Any other characters in the source code, including whitespace, are ignored.
